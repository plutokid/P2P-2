1.Drosera regia is a carnivorous plant in the sundew genus Drosera 
2.and is endemic to a single valley in South Africa. 
3.The tentacle-covered leaves can capture large prey, 
4.such as beetles, moths, and butterflies. The tentacles 
5.of all Drosera species are specialised stalked glands 
6.on the leaf's upper surface that produce a sticky mucilage. 
7.The leaves are considered active flypaper traps that respond 
8.to captured prey by bending to surround it. The genus name 
9.Drosera comes from the Greek word droseros, meaning "dew-covered". 
10.The specific epithet regia is derived from the Latin for "royal",
11.a reference to the "striking appearance" of the species. It has 
12.many unusual relict characteristics not found in most other 
13.Drosera species, and these factors, combined with molecular 
14.data from phylogenetic analysis, contribute to the evidence
15.that it possesses some of the most ancient characteristics 
16.within the genus. Of the two known populations of D. regia, 
17.the higher altitude site appears to be overgrown and 
18.is essentially extirpated. The lower altitude site 
19.is estimated to have about 50 mature plants, making 
20.it the most endangered Drosera species
21.since it is threatened with extinction in the wild.
